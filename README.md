# MFES-GoogleScholar

The goal of this project is to develop, test and document an executable formal model of a high integrity software system in VDM++ using the Overture tool or the VDMTools.

With the project, we developped skills in formal modeling of software systems in VDM++.

The purpose is to create a model of the Google Scholar platform (scholar.google.com), where information about papers and authors is stored, managed and accessed by any user.
